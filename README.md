## 📖 Introduction

In the realm of computer science and data analysis, the efficient navigation of paths and routes is crucial, especially in applications like mapping software, logistics, and navigation systems. The **Map Application with Dijkstra's Algorithm** represents a practical implementation of graph theory in a user-friendly web application. This application allows users to visualize the shortest path between two geographical points using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is renowned for its effectiveness in finding the shortest routes in weighted graphs.

## ✨ Features of the Application

### 🗺️ Interactive Map

At the core of the application lies an interactive map powered by **Leaflet.js**, a widely-used library for creating mobile-friendly, interactive maps. This feature enables users to seamlessly pan, zoom, and explore the map while entering their desired coordinates.

### 📍 User Input for Coordinates

Users can easily specify their source and destination points by entering latitude and longitude values into designated input fields. This straightforward interaction facilitates quick and efficient pathfinding.

### 🔍 Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path Calculation

The application employs Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a well-established method for determining the shortest path from a starting point to a target destination in a graph. By calculating the shortest distances based on user-provided coordinates, the application delivers accurate and reliable routing information.

### 🌐 Real-Time Data Retrieval

Leveraging the **Overpass API**, the application fetches real-time street data from **OpenStreetMap**, ensuring that the routing information reflects current conditions. This capability is essential for providing users with up-to-date navigation solutions.

### 🛰️ Satellite Imagery

To enhance the user experience, the application incorporates satellite imagery using the **Google Maps API**. This feature allows users to view the geographical area in high detail, improving their understanding of the environment surrounding the calculated route.

## 📚 Understanding Dijkstra's Algorithm

### 🔎 Overview

Dijkstra's algorithm, developed by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956, is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It is particularly effective for graphs with non-negative weights, making it ideal for navigation applications.

### ⚙️ How Dijkstra's Algorithm Works

The algorithm operates by maintaining a set of vertices with known shortest distances from the source node. The process unfolds as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm begins by assigning a tentative distance to every node in the graph. The starting node is assigned a distance of zero, while all other nodes are set to infinity.

2. **Unvisited Nodes**: A set of unvisited nodes is maintained, initially containing all nodes in the graph. The algorithm repeatedly selects the node with the smallest tentative distance from this set.

3. **Relaxation**: For the current node, the algorithm examines each of its unvisited neighbors. If a shorter path to a neighbor is discovered through the current node, the neighbor's tentative distance is updated.

4. **Marking as Visited**: Once all neighbors of the current node have been considered, the node is marked as visited and removed from the set of unvisited nodes.

5. **Repetition**: This process continues until all nodes have been visited or the shortest path to the target destination is found.

### 💡 Example Use Case

Imagine a delivery service that needs to determine the quickest route between two points in a city. By utilizing this application, users can input the start and end coordinates, and the application will leverage Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path, ensuring timely and efficient deliveries.
